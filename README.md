# NgReactiveForms
Handling user input with forms is the cornerstone of many common applications. Applications use forms to enable users to log in, to update a profile, to enter sensitive information, and to perform many other data-entry tasks.

Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: `reactive` and `template-driven`. Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes.

`Reactive` and `template-driven` forms process and manage form data differently. Each offers different advantages.

## Reactive Forms

In general: Reactive forms are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.

## Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4 for learning reactive forms.

## How to use

* Run "npm install" inside this project folder to install all dependencies.

* Make sure you use the relavent version of the CLI

* Run "ng serve" to see the app in action (try "npm start" in case "ng serve" fails).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
